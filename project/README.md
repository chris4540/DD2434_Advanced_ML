How to run SIF code

first of all, the install dependencies running in the command line:

pip install -r requiriments.txt

Then, download the file "glove.bin" sended by mail and paste it in the path "SIF/auxiliary_data/". Drive link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rBtDM_E05i6awX9wrQS0bRdt-cwuvcMZ

Finaly, just run the script "main_sif.py" without any parameter and it should work.

The code is an adaptation from the original repository:
